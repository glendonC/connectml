## üö¶ Quickstart

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/glendonC/connectml.git
   cd connectml
   
2. **Setup the backend**
    ```bash
    cd backend
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    uvicorn main:app --reload
  
 3. **Setup the frontend**
    ```bash
    cd frontend
    npm install
    npm run dev

The frontend will be available at http://localhost:5173 (default Vite port).

## üß† How It Works

Prompt: Enter a natural language description of your ML task.

Agent: AI agents interpret your prompt and design a pipeline.

2D/3D Visualization: Interactively build and explore your pipeline.

Component Catalog: Add, preview, and validate new ML components.

Export: Download ready-to-run code for your chosen framework.
